# Emissive Maps (Texture5,Texture14) - WIP
Emissive maps (often abbreviated _emi in texture names) are used for materials that emit their own light. 
In Smash Ultimate, these materials don't actually emit light onto other objects, but emission textures can still be 
used for lights, glowing patterns, or shadeless materials whose color isn't affected by lighting.
