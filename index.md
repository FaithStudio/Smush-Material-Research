# Getting Started
This site contains tutorials on various material, texture, and rendering related topics for Smash Ultimate. 
The tutorials, demos, and other documentation can be accessed from the top menu.
Many of these have interactive demos using WebGL, which should work on most computers, phones, and tablets.  

The documentation items link to the documentation pages on the main repository. These pages are more concise and not targeted at beginners. 
Check these links for up to date information, including topics not covered on this site.
