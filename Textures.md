# Col Maps
These are probably albedo textures due to the use of a metalness workflow.
RGBA = RGBA.

# PRM Maps
The main PBR textures. No idea what "prm" means.

*Note that these descriptions may change once more texture maps are analyzed.*  
R = metalness  
G = glossiness  
B = ambient occlusion  
A = specular (possibly reflectance at normal)

# Specular Cubemaps

# Gao Bake Maps
TODO: Used for stages. Probably ambient occlusion.

# Normal Maps
RG are used for the normal map. The B channel is likely a separate texture. A is possibly another texture.

# Bake Lit Maps
TODO: Some form of baked stage lighting.
