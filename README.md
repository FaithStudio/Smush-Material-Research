# Generating Data - WIP
## SQLite database
Most of the data is stored in an SQLite database generated by the CLI program in the [Smush-Material-DB](https://github.com/ScanMountGoat/Smush-Material-DB) repo.  
The repo contains instructions for how to run the tool. The database can be used with the provided python scripts for data visualization even without any SQL knowledge.
